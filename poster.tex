  \begin{block}{Introduction}

    % \vskip-1.45ex
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The timing of energy/nutrient intake has been previously shown to be associated with obesity and diabetes \cite{Almoosawi2019Chrono};
	\item Recently derived diurnal patterns of energy/carbohydrate intake suggested the potential interplay of circadian biology and social behaviour contributing to obesity \cite{Palla2019};
	% \item Evening intake of energy is positively associated with incidence of hypertension, and overweight/obesity \cite{Almoosawi2013,almoosawi2016chrono}.
  \item The relationship between food groups and the time when they are eaten is of interest, how such relationships vary by type 2 diabetes status is still left unknown.
\end{itemize}
    % \vskip-1.45ex



% Recent evidence suggested that there are three types of eaters \textbf{(grazers, early eaters, and late eaters)} according to the timing of energy consumption \cite{leech2017temporal,mansukhani2018investigating}. However, the temporal eating patterns were based on averaging the total energy intakeã€€ measured in the questionnaires and therefore \textbf{could not capture the day-to-day variation in eating patterns}. Furthermore, most previous studies have focused on describing temporal patterns of energy intake, \textbf{without considering the timing of macro-nutrient intake}.

%However, the temporal eating patterns were based only on averaging the total energy intake measured by 1 or 2 24-hour dietary recalls \cite{leech2017temporal} or 3 to 4 days' diet diary \cite{mansukhani2018investigating} and therefore \textbf{could not capture the day-to-day variation in eating patterns}, and \textbf{neither could it provide any clue of the temporal patterns specifically for nutrient intake}. 

%This is mainly due to limitations in the FFQ often used in observational studies and the lack of understanding of statistical techniques that can capture the complexity of eating patterns across the day. 

% This study aims at finding both time and quantity eating patterns specifically for carbohydrate (CH) intake in UK adults.

  \begin{block}{Data and Methodology}
    \vskip-1.85ex

\begin{itemize}
	\item National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP, 2008-2017) included 6802 adults (2810 men and 3992 women) aged 19 or older in the UK, and their 749,026 food recordings collected by a 4-day-diary.
	\item Time of the day was categorized into 7 slots: 6-9 am, 9-12 noon, 12-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, 8-10 pm and 10 pm-6 am.
	\item The derived contingency table between 60 food groups and the above 7 time slots were analyzed by Correspondence Analysis (CA). Biplots separately for the foods included in the food healthiness score  tertiles, for all adults combined and separately by diabetes status.
	
	\item The odds ratio estimate was derived of consuming unhealthy food groups later in the day compared to earlier in the day, by logistic regression.

% \somebody{The high-CH eaters profile seemed to be the healthiest. Low-CH eating which was crudely associated with higher prevalence of hypertension and obesity may have resulted from health/weight concerns, leading to fat or alcohol as replacements for CH. To ascertain the direction of causality in the association of CH patterns with blood pressure and obesity, prospective longitudinal studies are warranted. }
